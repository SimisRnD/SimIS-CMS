## Thoughts

1. [ISSUE] CSRF token is generated by each replica, resolve with db
2. [ISSUE] Cache distributed evictions if using CMS tools in production
3. [FEATURE] Plug-Ins when application starts (Plugin scanner; widget, database migrations, REST services, UI, etc.)
4. [FEATURE] Kafka broker for events and workflows, can extend from current asynchronous events
5. [FEATURE] Distributed components as needed
6. [FEATURE] WebHooks service for events (resilience similar to Dataset downloader); app, endpoint, headers, message
7. [FEATURE] Granular permissions; Open Policy Agent + Rego
8. [FEATURE] CDN setting
