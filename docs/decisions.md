## Vision

- Make it easy to extend the platform for public and private use
- Have a stable platform which is easy to maintain and deploy
- Encourage design, accessibility, and experimentation with style, layouts, features, and components
- Have a lean website stack which separates the CMS platform and the runtime requirements

## Decisions

- 2024: Implement a lean runtime stack
- 2023: Refine and extend the Web and Data modules
- 2022: Adapt to Kubernetes deployment methods, scalability, and capabilities
- 2022: Enhance groups, roles, and permissions; use containerization
- 2022: Public release with Apache Open Source License
- 2021: Add Dataset and Data Collections features
- 2020: Enhance E-Commerce and CMS features; add data and dataset modules
- 2019: Add E-Commerce features, add social network integrations, enhance CMS features
- 2018: Use Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- 2018: Use SQL, no web frameworks or database persistance dependencies for the core platform
- 2018: Use Open Source libraries and coding environments
- 2018: CMS first - core platform framework, settings management, CMS interface, API, analytics

## Thoughts

1. [ISSUE] CSRF token is generated by each replica, resolve with db
2. [ISSUE] Cache distributed evictions if using CMS tools in production
3. [FEATURE] Plug-Ins when application starts (Plugin scanner; widget, database migrations, REST services, UI, etc.)
4. [FEATURE] Kafka broker for events and workflows, can extend from current asynchronous events
5. [FEATURE] Distributed components as needed
6. [FEATURE] WebHooks service for events (resilience similar to Dataset downloader); app, endpoint, headers, message
7. [FEATURE] Granular permissions; Open Policy Agent + Rego
8. [FEATURE] CDN setting
